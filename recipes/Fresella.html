    <h3>Frisella description</h3>
    <p> Frisella (also called "frisa", "fresella" or "friseddhra" in Salento) is a sort of biscuit-shaped bread
         in the shape of a donut <br> or tarallo typical of Apulian, Campania, Calabrian and Lucanian cuisine. 
         It is a gastronomic product with durum wheat (or barley) <br> flour cooked in the oven,
         cut in half horizontally and toasted again in the oven. It follows that it has a porous and a compact face. <br>
         It is important to distinguish between frisa and bread: frisa is in fact not bread, as it is cooked twice.
